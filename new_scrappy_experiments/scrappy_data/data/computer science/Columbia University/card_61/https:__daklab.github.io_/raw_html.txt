Much of our understanding of the tumor microenvironment comes from in vitro studies isolating the interactions between malignant cells and a single stromal cell type, often along a single pathway. To develop a deeper understanding of the interactions between cells within human lung tumors we performed RNA-seq profiling of flow-sorted malignant cells, endothelial cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, and bulk cells from freshly resected human primary non-small-cell lung tumors. We mapped the cell-specific differential expression of prognostically-associated secreted factors and cell surface genes, and computationally reconstructed cross-talk between these cell types to generate a novel resource we call the Lung Tumor Microenvironment Interactome (LTMI). Using this resource, we identified and validated a prognostically unfavorable influence of Gremlin-1 production by fibroblasts on proliferation of malignant lung adenocarcinoma cells. We also found a prognostically favorable association between infiltration of mast cells and less aggressive tumor cell behavior. These results illustrate the utility of the LTMI as a resource for generating hypotheses concerning tumor-microenvironment interactions that may have prognostic and therapeutic relevance.<p>Summary RNA-seq profiling of sorted populations from primary lung cancer samples identifies prognostically relevant cross-talk between cell types in the tumor microenvironment.\n</p></div>\n<div id=\"bib_Gentles2019\" class=\"collapse\">\n<b>BibTeX</b>:\n<pre>@article{Gentles2019,\n  author = {Gentles, Andrew J and Hui, Angela Bik-Yu and Feng, Weiguo and Azizi, Armon and Nair, Ramesh V. and Knowles, David A. and Yu, Alice and Jeong, Youngtae and Bejnood, Alborz and Forg\u00f3, Erna and Varma, Sushama and Xu, Yue and Kuong, Amanda and Nair, Viswam S. and West, Rob and van de Rijn, Matt and Hoang, Chuong D. and Diehn, Maximilian and Plevritis, Sylvia K.},\n  title = {Clinically-relevant cell type cross-talk identified from a human lung tumor microenvironment interactome},\n  journal = {bioRxiv},\n  publisher = {Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory},\n  year = {2019},\n  url = {https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/637306v1.abstract},\n  doi = {10.1101/637306}\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n</li><li><div id=\"Knowles2015stochastic\"><em>Knowles DA</em> (2015), <strong>\"Stochastic gradient variational Bayes for gamma approximating distributions\"</strong>, arXiv. , pp. 1509.01631.</div>\n<div>[<a data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#abs_Knowles2015stochastic\">Abstract</a>][<a href=\"#bib_Knowles2015stochastic\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">BibTeX</a>] [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01631\" target=\"_blank\">URL</a>] [<a href=\"https://github.com/davidaknowles/gamma_sgvb\" target=\"_blank\">Code</a>]</div>\n\n<div id=\"abs_Knowles2015stochastic\" class=\"collapse\">\n\t<b>Abstract</b>: While stochastic variational inference is relatively well known for scaling inference in Bayesian probabilistic models, related methods also offer ways to circumnavigate the approximation of analytically intractable expectations.

In this paper we apply the same idea to gamma distributed latent variables given gamma variational distributions, enabling straightforward \"black box\" variational inference in models where sparsity and non-negativity are appropriate. We demonstrate the method on a recently proposed gamma process model for network data, as well as a novel sparse factor analysis.

Several authors have therefore suggested using control variates to reduce this variance, while we have taken a different but analogous approach to reducing the variance which we call stochastic linear regression. In this note we take the former perspective and derive the ideal set of control variates for stochastic approximation variational Bayes under a certain set of assumptions. We then show that using these control variates is closely related to using the stochastic linear regression approximation technique we proposed earlier. A simple example shows that our method for constructing control variates leads to stochastic estimators with much lower variance compared to other approaches.\n</div>\n<div id=\"bib_salimans2014using\" class=\"collapse\">\n<b>BibTeX</b>:\n<pre>@article{salimans2014using,\n  author = {Salimans, Tim and Knowles, David A},\n  title = {On using control variates with stochastic approximation for variational Bayes and its connection to stochastic linear regression},\n  journal = {arXiv},\n  year = {2014},\n  pages = {1401.1022},\n  url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1022}\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n</li><li><div id=\"palla2013dependent\"><em>Palla* K, Knowles* DA and Ghahramani Z</em> (2013), <strong>\"A dependent partition-valued process for multitask clustering and time evolving network modeling\"</strong>, arXiv. , pp. 1303.3265. *These authors contributed equally to this work.</div>\n<div>[<a data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#abs_palla2013dependent\">Abstract</a>][<a href=\"#bib_palla2013dependent\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">BibTeX</a>] [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3265\" target=\"_blank\">URL</a>]</div>\n\n<div id=\"abs_palla2013dependent\" class=\"collapse\">\n\t<b>Abstract</b>: The fundamental aim of clustering algorithms is to partition data points.

We define a partition-valued process on an arbitrary covariate space using Gaussian processes. We use the process to construct a multitask clustering model which partitions datapoints in a similar way across multiple data sources, and a time series model of network data which allows cluster assignments to vary over time.

Prior cross-sectional studies have<br>              investigated the combined effects of age and genetics on gene<br>              expression and alternative splicing; however, there has been no<br>              long-term, longitudinal characterization of these molecular<br>              changes, especially in older age. RESULTS: We perform RNA<br>              sequencing in whole blood from the same individuals at ages 70<br>              and 80 to quantify how gene expression, alternative splicing, and<br>              their genetic regulation are altered during this 10-year period<br>              of advanced aging at a population and individual level. We<br>              observe that individuals are more similar to their own expression<br>              profiles later in life than profiles of other individuals their<br>              own age. We identify 1291 and 294 genes differentially expressed<br>              and alternatively spliced with age, as well as 529 genes with<br>              outlying individual trajectories. Further, we observe a strong<br>              correlation of genetic effects on expression and splicing between<br>              the two ages, with a small subset of tested genes showing a<br>              reduction in genetic associations with expression and splicing in<br>              older age. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that, although<br>              the transcriptome and its genetic regulation is mostly stable<br>              late in life, a small subset of genes is dynamic and is<br>              characterized by a reduction in genetic regulation, most likely<br>              due to increasing environmental variance with age.\n</div>\n<div id=\"bib_Balliu2019-bp\" class=\"collapse\">\n<b>BibTeX</b>:\n<pre>@article{Balliu2019-bp,\n  author = {Balliu, Brunilda and Durrant, Matthew and Goede, Olivia de and Abell, Nathan and Li, Xin and Liu, Boxiang and Gloudemans, Michael J and Cook, Naomi L and Smith, Kevin S and Knowles, David A and Pala, Mauro and Cucca, Francesco and Schlessinger, David and Jaiswal, Siddhartha and Sabatti, Chiara and Lind, Lars and Ingelsson, Erik and Montgomery, Stephen B},\n  title = {Genetic regulation of gene expression and splicing during a 10-year period of human aging},\n  journal = {Genome Biol.},\n  year = {2019},\n  volume = {20},\n  number = {1},\n  pages = {230}\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n</li><li><div id=\"Calderon2018immune\"><em>Calderon D, Nguyen ML, Mezger A, Kathiria A, Nguyen V, Lescano N, Wu B, Trombetta J, Ribado JV, Knowles DA, Gao Z, Parent AV, Burt TD, Anderson MS, Criswell LA, Greenleaf WJ, Marson A and Pritchard JK</em> (2019), <strong>\"Landscape of stimulation-responsive chromatin across diverse human immune cells\"</strong>, Nature Genetics. </div>\n<div>[<a data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#abs_Calderon2018immune\">Abstract</a>][<a href=\"#bib_Calderon2018immune\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">BibTeX</a>] [<a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/05/409722\" target=\"_blank\">URL</a>]</div>\n\n<div id=\"abs_Calderon2018immune\" class=\"collapse\">\n\t<b>Abstract</b>: The immune system is controlled by a balanced interplay among specialized cell types transitioning between resting and stimulated states. Despite its importance, the regulatory landscape of this system has not yet been fully characterized. To address this gap, we collected ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data under resting and stimulated conditions for 25 immune cell types from peripheral blood of four healthy individuals, and seven cell types from three fetal thymus samples. We found that stimulation caused widespread chromatin remodeling, including a large class of response elements shared between stimulated B and T cells. Furthermore, several autoimmune traits showed significant heritability in stimulation-responsive elements from distinct cell types, highlighting the critical importance of these cell states in autoimmunity. Use of allele-specific read-mapping identified thousands of variants that alter chromatin accessibility in particular conditions. Notably, variants associated with changes in stimulation-specific chromatin accessibility were not enriched for associations with gene expression regulation in whole blood -- a tissue commonly used in eQTL studies. Thus, large-scale maps of variants associated with gene regulation lack a condition important for understanding autoimmunity. As a proof-of-principle we identified variant rs6927172, which links stimulated T cell-specific chromatin dysregulation in the TNFAIP3 locus to ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis. Overall, our results provide a broad resource of chromatin landscape dynamics and highlight the need for large-scale characterization of effects of genetic variation in stimulated cells.\n</div>\n<div id=\"bib_Calderon2018immune\" class=\"collapse\">\n<b>BibTeX</b>:\n<pre>@article{Calderon2018immune,\n  author = {Calderon, Diego and Nguyen, Michelle L.T. and Mezger, Anja and Kathiria, Arwa and Nguyen, Vinh and Lescano, Ninnia and Wu, Beijing and Trombetta, John and Ribado, Jessica V. and Knowles, David A. and Gao, Ziyue and Parent, Audrey V. and Burt, Trevor D. and Anderson, Mark S. and Criswell, Lindsey A. and Greenleaf, William J. and Marson, Alexander and Pritchard, Jonathan K.},\n  title = {Landscape of stimulation-responsive chromatin across diverse human immune cells},\n  journal = {Nature Genetics},\n  year = {2019},\n  url = {https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/09/05/409722}\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n</li><li><div id=\"Jaganathan2019-kb\"><em>Jaganathan K, Kyriazopoulou Panagiotopoulou S, McRae JF, Darbandi SF, Knowles D, Li YI, Kosmicki JA, Arbelaez J, Cui W, Schwartz GB, Chow ED, Kanterakis E, Gao H, Kia A, Batzoglou S, Sanders SJ and Farh KK-H</em> (2019), <strong>\"Predicting Splicing from Primary Sequence with Deep Learning\"</strong>, Cell., January, 2019.

However, the genetic basis of sensitivity to anthracyclines such as doxorubicin remains unclear. To begin addressing this, we created a panel of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from 45 individuals and performed RNA-seq after 24h exposure to varying levels of doxorubicin. The transcriptomic response to doxorubicin is substantial, with the majority of genes being differentially expressed across treatments of different concentrations and over 6000 genes showing evidence of differential splicing. Overall, our observations indicate that splicing fidelity decreases in the presence of doxorubicin. We detect 376 response-expression QTLs and 42 response-splicing QTLs, i.e. genetic variants that modulate the individual transcriptomic response to doxorubicin in terms of expression and splicing changes respectively. We show that inter-individual variation in transcriptional response is predictive of cell damage measured <em>in vitro</em> using a cardiac troponin assay, which in turn is shown to be associated with <em>in vivo</em> ACT risk. Finally, the molecular QTLs we detected are enriched in lower ACT GWAS p-values, further supporting the <em>in vivo</em> relevance of our map of genetic regulation of cellular response to anthracyclines.\n</div>\n<div id=\"bib_Knowles2018dox\" class=\"collapse\">\n<b>BibTeX</b>:\n<pre>@article{Knowles2018dox,\n  author = {Knowles*, David A and Burrows*, Courtney K and Blischak, John D and Patterson, Kristen M and Serie, Daniel J. and Norton, Nadine and Ober, Carole and Pritchard, Jonathan K and Gilad, Yoav},\n  title = {Determining the genetic basis of anthracycline-cardiotoxicity by molecular response QTL mapping in induced cardiomyocytes},\n  journal = {eLife},\n  year = {2018},\n  url = {https://elifesciences.org/articles/33480},\n  doi = {10.7554/eLife.33480}\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n</li><li><div id=\"Leland_Taylor2018-lb\"><em>Leland Taylor D, Knowles DA, Scott LJ, Ramirez AH, Casale FP, Wolford BN, Guan L, Varshney A, Albanus RD, Parker SCJ, Narisu N, Chines PS, Erdos MR, Welch RP, Kinnunen L, Saramies J, Sundvall J, Lakka TA, Laakso M, Tuomilehto J, Koistinen HA, Stegle O, Boehnke M, Birney E and Collins FS</em> (2018), <strong>\"Interactions between genetic variation and cellular environment in skeletal muscle gene expression\"</strong>, PLoS One., April, 2018.

RNA-sequencing quantifies gene expression<br>               as a molecular trait, and is capable of capturing both genetic<br>               and environmental effects. In this study, we explore<br>               opportunities of using allele-specific expression (ASE) to<br>               discover cis-acting genotype-environment interactions<br>               (GxE)---genetic effects on gene expression that depend on an<br>               environmental condition. Treating 17 common, clinical traits as<br>               approximations of the cellular environment of 267 skeletal<br>               muscle biopsies, we identify 10 candidate environmental response<br>               expression quantitative trait loci (reQTLs) across 6 traits (12<br>               unique gene-environment trait pairs; 10% FDR per trait)<br>               including sex, systolic blood pressure, and low-density<br>               lipoprotein cholesterol.

Nearly all patients with ALS have aggregates of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 in their brains and spinal cords 2 , and rare mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 can cause ALS 3 . There are no effective TDP-43-directed therapies for ALS or related TDP-43 proteinopathies, such as frontotemporal dementia. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and RNA-interference approaches are emerging as attractive therapeutic strategies in neurological diseases 4 . Indeed, treatment of a rat model of inherited ALS (caused by a mutation in Sod1) with ASOs against Sod1 has been shown to substantially slow disease progression 5 . However, as SOD1 mutations account for only around 2--5% of ALS cases, additional therapeutic strategies are needed. Silencing TDP-43 itself is probably not appropriate, given its critical cellular functions 1,6 . Here we present a promising alternative therapeutic strategy for ALS that involves targeting ataxin-2. A decrease in ataxin-2 suppresses TDP-43 toxicity in yeast and flies 7 , and intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions in the ataxin-2 gene increase risk of ALS 7,8 . We used two independent approaches to test whether decreasing ataxin-2 levels could mitigate disease in a mouse model of TDP-43 proteinopathy 9 . First, we crossed ataxin-2 knockout mice with TDP-43 (also known as TARDBP) transgenic mice. The decrease in ataxin-2 reduced aggregation of TDP-43, markedly increased survival and improved motor function. Second, in a more therapeutically applicable approach, we administered ASOs targeting ataxin-2 to the central nervous system of TDP-43 transgenic mice. This single treatment markedly extended survival. Because TDP-43 aggregation is a component of nearly all cases of ALS 6 , targeting ataxin-2 could represent a broadly effective therapeutic strategy.

However, these studies are limited in cell resolution by the lack of functional annotations from difficult-to-characterize or rare cell populations. Measurement of single-cell gene expression has become a popular method for characterizing novel cell types, and yet, hardly any work exists linking single-cell RNA-seq to phenotypes of interest. To address this deficiency, we present RolyPoly, a regression-based polygenic model that can prioritize trait-relevant cell types and genes from GWAS summary statistics and single-cell RNA-seq. We demonstrate RolyPoly's accuracy through simulation and validate previously known tissue-trait associations. We discover a significant association between microglia and late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and an association between oligodendrocytes and replicating fetal cortical cells with schizophrenia. Additionally, RolyPoly computes a trait-relevance score for each gene which reflects the importance of expression specific to a cell type. We found that differentially expressed genes in the prefrontal cortex of Alzheimer's patients were significantly enriched for highly ranked genes by RolyPoly gene scores. Overall, our method represents a powerful framework for understanding the effect of common variants on cell types contributing to complex traits.\n</div>\n<div id=\"bib_Calderon2017\" class=\"collapse\">\n<b>BibTeX</b>:\n<pre>@article{Calderon2017,\n  author = {Calderon, Diego and Bhaskar, Anand and Knowles, David A and Golan, David and Raj, Towfique and Fu, Audrey Q and Pritchard, Jonathan K},\n  title = {Inferring Relevant Cell Types for Complex Traits by Using Single-Cell Gene Expression},\n  journal = {American Journal of Human Genetics},\n  year = {2017},\n  url = {http://www.cell.com/ajhg/abstract/S0002-9297(17)30378-6}\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n</li><li><div id=\"Knowles2017gxe\"><em>Knowles DA, Davis JR, Edgington H, Raj A, Fav\u00e9 M-J, Zhu X, Potash JB, Weissman MM, Shi J, Levinson D, Awadalla P, Mostafavi S, Montgomery SB and Battle A</em> (2017), <strong>\"Allele-specific expression reveals interactions between genetic variation and environment\"</strong>, Nature Methods. </div>\n<div>[<a data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#abs_Knowles2017gxe\">Abstract</a>][<a href=\"#bib_Knowles2017gxe\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">BibTeX</a>] [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4298\" target=\"_blank\">DOI</a>] [<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nmeth.4298.html\" target=\"_blank\">URL</a>] [<a href=\"http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/09/13/025874.abstract\" target=\"_blank\">Preprint</a>] [<a href=\"https://github.com/davidaknowles/eagle\" target=\"_blank\">Code</a>]</div>\n\n<div id=\"abs_Knowles2017gxe\" class=\"collapse\">\n\t<b>Abstract</b>: Identifying interactions between genetics and the environment (GxE) remains challenging.

Across individuals, we show that selective export of miRNAs occurs not only at the level of specific transcripts, but that a cluster of 74 mature miRNAs on chromosome 14q32 is massively exported in exosomes while mostly absent from cells. We also observe more interindividual variability between exosomal samples than between cellular ones and identify four miRNA expression quantitative trait loci shared between cells and exosomes. Our findings indicate that genomically colocated miRNAs can be exported together and highlight the variability in exosomal miRNA levels between individuals as relevant for exosome use as diagnostics.\n</div>\n<div id=\"bib_Tsang2017\" class=\"collapse\">\n<b>BibTeX</b>:\n<pre>@article{Tsang2017,\n  author = {Tsang, Emily K. and Abell, Nathan S. and Li, Xin and Anaya, Vanessa and Karczewski, Konrad J. and Knowles, David A. and Sierra, Raymond G. and Smith, Kevin S. and Montgomery, Stephen B.},\n  title = {Small RNA sequencing in cells and exosomes identifies eQTLs and 14q32 as a region of active export},\n  journal = {G3 Genes|Genomes|Genetics},\n  year = {2017},\n  volume = {7},\n  number = {1},\n  pages = {31--39},\n  url = {http://g3journal.org/lookup/doi/10.1534/g3.116.036137},\n  doi = {10.1534/g3.116.036137}\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n</li><li><div id=\"Tung2017\"><em>Tung P-Y, Blischak JD, Hsiao CJ, Knowles DA, Burnett JE, Pritchard JK and Gilad Y</em> (2017), <strong>\"Batch effects and the effective design of single-cell gene expression studies\"</strong>, Scientific Reports.

To do so, we processed three C1 replicates from three human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. We added unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to all samples, to account for amplification bias. We found that the major source of variation in the gene expression data was driven by genotype, but we also observed substantial variation between the technical replicates. We observed that the conversion of reads to molecules using the UMIs was impacted by both biological and technical variation, indicating that UMI counts are not an unbiased estimator of gene expression levels.

Bonferroni correction, though computationally trivial, is overly conservative and fails to account for linkage disequilibrium between variants. Permutation-based methods are more powerful, though computationally far more intensive. We present an alternative correction method called eigenMT, which runs over 500 times faster than permutations and has adjusted p values that closely approximate empirical ones. To achieve this speed while also maintaining the accuracy of permutation-based methods, we estimate the effective number of independent variants tested for association with a particular gene, termed Meff, by using the eigenvalue decomposition of the genotype correlation matrix. We employ a regularized estimator of the correlation matrix to ensure Meff is robust and yields adjusted p values that closely approximate p values from permutations. Finally, using a common genotype matrix, we show that eigenMT can be applied with even greater efficiency to studies across tissues or conditions. Our method provides a simpler, more efficient approach to multiple-testing correction than existing methods and fits within existing pipelines for eQTL discovery.\n</div>\n<div id=\"bib_Davis2016eigenmt\" class=\"collapse\">\n<b>BibTeX</b>:\n<pre>@article{Davis2016eigenmt,\n  author = {Davis, Joe R. and Fresard, Laure and Knowles, David A. and Pala, Mauro and Bustamante, Carlos D. and Battle, Alexis and Montgomery, Stephen B.},\n  title = {An Efficient Multiple-Testing Adjustment for eQTL Studies that Accounts for Linkage Disequilibrium between Variants},\n  journal = {The American Journal of Human Genetics},\n  year = {2016},\n  volume = {98},\n  number = {1},\n  pages = {216--224},\n  url = {http://www.cell.com/ajhg/abstract/S0002-9297(15)00492-9},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.11.021}\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n</li><li><div id=\"Kukurba2015\"><em>Kukurba KR, Parsana P, Balliu B, Smith KS, Zappala Z, Knowles DA, Fav\u00e9 M-J, Davis JR, Li X, Zhu X, Potash JB, Weissman MM, Shi J, Kundaje A, Levinson DF, Awadalla P, Mostafavi S, Battle A and Montgomery SB</em> (2016), <strong>\"Impact of the X chromosome and sex on regulatory variation\"</strong>, Genome Research.

We have conducted an analysis of the impact of both sex and the X chromosome on patterns of gene expression identified through transcriptome sequencing of whole blood from 922 individuals. We identified that genes on the X chromosome are more likely to have sex-specific expression compared to the autosomal genes. Furthermore, we identified a depletion of regulatory variants on the X chromosome, especially among genes under high selective constraint. In contrast, we discovered an enrichment of sex-specific regulatory variants on the X chromosome. To resolve the molecular mechanisms underlying such effects, we generated and connected sex-specific chromatin accessibility to sex-specific expression and regulatory variation. As sex-specific regulatory variants can inform sex differences in genetic disease prevalence, we have integrated our data with genome-wide association study data for multiple immune traits and to identify traits with significant sex biases.

However, for each allele, accurate interpretation of its effect will depend on both its penetrance and the trait's expressivity. In this regard, an important factor that can modify the effect of a pathogenic coding allele is its level of expression; a factor which itself characteristically changes across tissues. To better inform the degree to which pathogenic alleles can be modified by expression level across multiple tissues, we have conducted exome, RNA and deep, targeted allele-specific expression (ASE) sequencing in ten tissues obtained from a single individual. By combining such data, we report the impact of rare and common loss-of-function variants on allelic expression exposing stronger allelic bias for rare stop-gain variants and informing the extent to which rare deleterious coding alleles are consistently expressed across tissues.

To date, much of the focus has been on rare protein-coding variants, for which potential impact can be estimated from the genetic code, but determining the impact of rare noncoding variants has been more challenging. To improve our understanding of such variants, we combined high-quality genome sequencing and RNA sequencing data from a 17-individual, three-generation family to contrast expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) within this family to eQTLs and sQTLs within a population sample. Using this design, we found that eQTLs and sQTLs with large effects in the family were enriched with rare regulatory and splicing variants (minor allele frequency 0.01). They were also more likely to influence essential genes and genes involved in complex disease. In addition, we tested the capacity of diverse noncoding annotation to predict the impact of rare noncoding variants. We found that distance to the transcription start site, evolutionary constraint, and epigenetic annotation were considerably more informative for predicting the impact of rare variants than for predicting the impact of common variants. These results highlight that rare noncoding variants are important contributors to individual gene-expression profiles and further demonstrate a significant capability for genomic annotation to predict the impact of rare noncoding variants..\n</div>\n<div id=\"bib_Li2014rare\" class=\"collapse\">\n<b>BibTeX</b>:\n<pre>@article{Li2014rare,\n  author = {Li, Xin and Battle, Alexis and Karczewski, Konrad J. and Zappala, Zach and Knowles, David A. and Smith, Kevin S. and Kukurba, Kim R. and Wu, Eric and Simon, Noah and Montgomery, Stephen B.},\n  title = {Transcriptome sequencing of a large human family identifies the impact of rare noncoding variants.},\n  journal = {American Journal of Human Genetics},\n  publisher = {Elsevier},\n  year = {2014},\n  volume = {95},\n  number = {3},\n  pages = {245--56},\n  url = {http://www.cell.com/article/S0002929714003486/fulltext},\n  doi = {10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.08.004}\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n</li><li><div id=\"Glass2013muther\"><em>Glass D, Vi\u00f1uela A, Davies MN, Ramasamy A, Parts L, Knowles DA, Brown AA, Hedman AK, Small KS, Buil A, Grundberg E, Nica AC, Meglio P, Nestle FO, Ryten M, Durbin R, McCarthy MI, Deloukas P, Dermitzakis ET, Weale ME, Bataille V and Spector TD</em> (2013), <strong>\"Gene expression changes with age in skin, adipose tissue, blood and brain.\"</strong>, Genome biology.

Additionally, we investigated genotypic variants involved in genotype-by-age interactions to understand how the genomic regulation of gene expression alters with age.  RESULTS: Using a linear mixed model, differential expression with age was identified in 1,672 genes in skin and 188 genes in adipose tissue. Only two genes expressed in lymphoblastoid cell lines showed significant changes with age. Genes significantly regulated by age were compared with expression profiles in 10 brain regions from 100 postmortem brains aged 16 to 83 years. We identified only one age-related gene common to the three tissues. There were 12 genes that showed differential expression with age in both skin and brain tissue and three common to adipose and brain tissues.  CONCLUSIONS: Skin showed the most age-related gene expression changes of all the tissues investigated, with many of the genes being previously implicated in fatty acid metabolism, mitochondrial activity, cancer and splicing. A significant proportion of age-related changes in gene expression appear to be tissue-specific with only a few genes sharing an age effect in expression across tissues. More research is needed to improve our understanding of the genetic influences on aging and the relationship with age-related diseases.\n</div>\n<div id=\"bib_Glass2013muther\" class=\"collapse\">\n<b>BibTeX</b>:\n<pre>@article{Glass2013muther,\n  author = {Glass, Daniel and Vi\u00f1uela, Ana and Davies, Matthew N and Ramasamy, Adaikalavan and Parts, Leopold and Knowles, David A. and Brown, Andrew A and Hedman, Asa K and Small, Kerrin S and Buil, Alfonso and Grundberg, Elin and Nica, Alexandra C and Meglio, Paoladi and Nestle, Frank O and Ryten, Mina and Durbin, Richard and McCarthy, Mark I and Deloukas, Panagiotis and Dermitzakis, Emmanouil T and Weale, Michael E and Bataille, Veronique and Spector, Tim D},\n  title = {Gene expression changes with age in skin, adipose tissue, blood and brain.},\n  journal = {Genome biology},\n  year = {2013},\n  volume = {14},\n  number = {7},\n  pages = {R75},\n  url = {http://genomebiology.com/2013/14/7/R75},\n  doi = {10.1186/gb-2013-14-7-r75}\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n</li><li><div id=\"Grundberg2012\"><em>Grundberg E, Small KS, Hedman AK, Nica AC, Buil A, Keildson S, Bell JT, Yang T-P, Meduri E, Barrett A, Nisbett J, Sekowska M, Wilk A, Shin S-Y, Glass D, Travers M, Min JL, Knowles DA, Ring S, Ho K, Thorleifsson G, Kong A, Thorsteindottir U, Ainali C, Dimas AS, Hassanali N, Ingle C, Krestyaninova M, Lowe CE, Di Meglio P, Montgomery SB, Parts L, Potter S, Surdulescu G, Tsaprouni L, Tsoka S, Bataille V, Durbin R, Nestle FO, O'Rahilly S, Soranzo N, Lindgren CM, Zondervan KT, Ahmadi KR, Schadt EE, Stefansson K, Smith GD, McCarthy MI, Deloukas P, Dermitzakis ET and Spector TD</em> (2012), <strong>\"Mapping cis- and trans-regulatory effects across multiple tissues in twins.\"</strong>, Nature Genetics.

Common variants regulating expression in cis have been mapped in many expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, typically in single tissues from unrelated individuals. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of gene expression across multiple tissues conducted in a large set of mono- and dizygotic twins that allows systematic dissection of genetic (cis and trans) and non-genetic effects on gene expression. Using identity-by-descent estimates, we show that at least 40% of the total heritable cis effect on expression cannot be accounted for by common cis variants, a finding that reveals the contribution of low-frequency and rare regulatory variants with respect to both transcriptional regulation and complex trait susceptibility. We show that a substantial proportion of gene expression heritability is trans to the structural gene, and we identify several replicating trans variants that act predominantly in a tissue-restricted manner and may regulate the transcription of many genes.\n</div>\n<div id=\"bib_Grundberg2012\" class=\"collapse\">\n<b>BibTeX</b>:\n<pre>@article{Grundberg2012,\n  author = {Grundberg, Elin and Small, Kerrin S and Hedman, Asa K and Nica, Alexandra C and Buil, Alfonso and Keildson, Sarah and Bell, Jordana T and Yang, Tsun-Po and Meduri, Eshwar and Barrett, Amy and Nisbett, James and Sekowska, Magdalena and Wilk, Alicja and Shin, So-Youn and Glass, Daniel and Travers, Mary and Min, Josine L and Knowles, David A. and Ring, Sue and Ho, Karen and Thorleifsson, Gudmar and Kong, Augustine and Thorsteindottir, Unnur and Ainali, Chrysanthi and Dimas, Antigone S and Hassanali, Neelam and Ingle, Catherine and Krestyaninova, Maria and Lowe, Christopher E and Di Meglio, Paola and Montgomery, Stephen B and Parts, Leopold and Potter, Simon and Surdulescu, Gabriela and Tsaprouni, Loukia and Tsoka, Sophia and Bataille, Veronique and Durbin, Richard and Nestle, Frank O and O'Rahilly, Stephen and Soranzo, Nicole and Lindgren, Cecilia M and Zondervan, Krina T and Ahmadi, Kourosh R and Schadt, Eric E and Stefansson, Kari and Smith, George Davey and McCarthy, Mark I and Deloukas, Panos and Dermitzakis, Emmanouil T and Spector, Tim D.},\n  title = {Mapping cis- and trans-regulatory effects across multiple tissues in twins.},\n  journal = {Nature Genetics},\n  year = {2012},\n  volume = {44},\n  number = {10},\n  pages = {1084--9},\n  url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ng.2394},\n  doi = {10.1038/ng.2394}\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n</li><li><div id=\"Movassagh2011a\"><em>Movassagh M, Choy M-K, Knowles DA, Cordeddu L, Haider S, Down T, Siggens L, Vujic A, Simeoni I, Penkett C, Goddard M, Lio P, Bennett M and Foo R</em> (2011), <strong>\"Distinct Epigenomic Features in End-Stage Failing Human Hearts\"</strong>, Circulation, American Heart Association.

More than 506 Mb sequences per library were generated by high-throughput sequencing, allowing us to assign methylation scores to \u224828 million CG dinucleotides in the human genome. DNA methylation was significantly different in promoter CpG islands, intragenic CpG islands, gene bodies, and H3K36me3-enriched regions of the genome. DNA methylation differences were present in promoters of upregulated genes but not downregulated genes. H3K36me3 enrichment itself was also significantly different in coding regions of the genome. Specifically, abundance of RNA transcripts encoded by the DUX4 locus correlated to differential DNA methylation and H3K36me3 enrichment. In vitro, Dux gene expression was responsive to a specific inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, and Dux siRNA knockdown led to reduced cell viability.</p><p>CONCLUSIONS:<br>Distinct epigenomic patterns exist in important DNA elements of the cardiac genome in human end-stage cardiomyopathy. The epigenome may control the expression of local or distal genes with critical functions in myocardial stress response. If epigenomic patterns track with disease progression, assays for the epigenome may be useful for assessing prognosis in heart failure.

However, at the level of cellular and network properties, it remains unclear whether Hcrt/Orx neurons are one homogeneous population, or whether there are several distinct types of Hcrt/Orx cells. Here, we collated diverse structural and functional information about individual Hcrt/Orx neurons in mouse brain slices, by combining patch-clamp analysis of spike firing, membrane currents and synaptic inputs with confocal imaging of cell shape and subsequent 3-dimensional Sholl analysis of dendritic architecture. Statistical cluster analysis of intrinsic firing properties revealed that Hcrt/Orx neurons fall into two distinct types. These two cell types also differ in the complexity of their dendritic arbour, the strength of AMPA and GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic drive that they receive, and the density of low-threshold, 4-aminopyridine-sensitive, transient K+ current. Our results provide quantitative evidence that, at the cellular level, the mouse Hcrt/Orx system is composed of two classes of neurons with different firing properties, morphologies and synaptic input organization.\n</div>\n<div id=\"bib_Schone2011\" class=\"collapse\">\n<b>BibTeX</b>:\n<pre>@article{Schone2011,\n  author = {Sch\u00f6ne, Cornelia and Venner, Anne and Knowles, David A. and Karnani, Mahesh M and Burdakov, Denis},\n  title = {Dichotomous cellular properties of mouse orexin/hypocretin neurons.},\n  journal = {The Journal of Physiology},\n  year = {2011},\n  volume = {589},\n  number = {Pt 11},\n  pages = {2767--79},\n  url = {http://jp.physoc.org/content/early/2011/04/11/jphysiol.2011.208637.abstract},\n  doi = {10.1113/jphysiol.2011.208637}\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n</li><li><div id=\"Glass2010\"><em>Glass D, Parts L, Knowles D, Aviv A and Spector TD</em> (2010), <strong>\"No correlation between childhood maltreatment and telomere length.\"</strong>, Biological psychiatry.

Given a tissue image, our goal is to classify detected nuclei into different types, for example nuclei of tumor cells, stroma cells, or immune cells. State-of-the-art methods achieve this by extracting different types of features such as morphology, image intensities, and texture features in the nucleus regions. Such features are input to training and classification, e.g. using a support vector machine. In this paper, we introduce additional contextual information obtained from neighboring nuclei or texture in the surrounding tissue regions to improve nucleus classification. Three different methods are presented. These methods use conditional random fields (CRF), texture features computed in image patches centered at each nucleus, and a novel method based on the bag-of-word (BoW) model. The methods are evaluated on images of tumor-burdened tissue from H&amp;E-stained and Ki-67-stained breast samples. The experimental results show that contextual information systematically improves classification accuracy. The proposed BoW-based method performs better than the CRF-based method, and requires less computation than the texture-feature-based method.\n</div>\n<div id=\"bib_nguyen2015using\" class=\"collapse\">\n<b>BibTeX</b>:\n<pre>@inproceedings{nguyen2015using,\n  author = {Nguyen, Kien and Bredno, Joerg and Knowles, David A},\n  title = {Using contextual information to classify nuclei in histology images},\n  booktitle = {IEEE 12th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)},\n  year = {2015},\n  pages = {995--998},\n  url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2015.7164038}\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n</li><li><div id=\"Palla2015\"><em>Palla K, Knowles DA and Ghahramani Z</em> (2015), <strong>\"Relational learning and network modelling using infinite latent attribute models\"</strong>, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence Special Issue on Bayesian Nonparametrics.

The simplest possible models subdivide nodes of the network into clusters; the probability of a link between any two nodes then depends only on their cluster assignment. Currently available models can be classified by whether clusters are disjoint or are allowed to overlap. These models can explain a flat clustering structure. Hierarchical Bayesian models provide a natural approach to capture more complex dependencies. We propose a model in which objects are characterised by a latent feature vector. Each feature is itself partitioned into disjoint groups (subclusters), corresponding to a second layer of hierarchy. In experimental comparisons, the model achieves significantly improved predictive performance on social and biological link prediction tasks.

Deriving several new algorithms, and using synthetic, image and genomic datasets, we investigate whether the understanding gleaned from LDA applies in the setting of sparse latent factor models, specifically beta process factor analysis (BPFA). We demonstrate that the big picture is consistent: using Gibbs sampling within SVI to maintain certain posterior dependencies is extremely effective. However, we find that different posterior dependencies are important in BPFA relative to LDA.

The resulting prior over infinite transition matrices is closely related to the hierarchical Dirichlet process but enforces reversibility. A reinforcement scheme has recently been proposed with similar properties, but the de Finetti measure is not well characterised. We take the alternative approach of explicitly constructing the mixing measure, which allows more straightforward and efficient inference at the cost of no longer having a closed form predictive distribution. We use our process to construct a reversible infinite HMM which we apply to two real datasets, one from epigenomics and one ion channel recording.\n</div>\n<div id=\"bib_Knowles2014a\" class=\"collapse\">\n<b>BibTeX</b>:\n<pre>@inproceedings{Knowles2014a,\n  author = {Knowles, David A. and Palla, Konstantina and Ghahramani, Zoubin},\n  title = {A reversible infinite HMM using normalised random measures},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of The 31st International Conference on Machine Learning},\n  year = {2014},\n  url = {http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/knowles14.pdf}\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n</li><li><div id=\"quadrianto2013supervised\"><em>Quadrianto N, Sharmanska V, Knowles DA and Ghahramani Z</em> (2013), <strong>\"The Supervised IBP: Neighbourhood Preserving Infinite Latent Feature Models\"</strong>, In Proceedings of the 29th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence. </div>\n<div>[<a data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#abs_quadrianto2013supervised\">Abstract</a>][<a href=\"#bib_quadrianto2013supervised\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">BibTeX</a>] [<a href=\"http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/pdf/QuaShaKnoGha13.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">URL</a>]</div>\n\n<div id=\"abs_quadrianto2013supervised\" class=\"collapse\">\n\t<b>Abstract</b>: We propose a probabilistic model to infer supervised latent variables in the Hamming space from observed data. Our model allows simultaneous inference of the number of binary latent variables, and their values. The latent variables preserve neighbourhood structure of the data in a sense that objects in the same semantic concept have similar latent values, and objects in different concepts have dissimilar latent values. We formulate the supervised infinite latent variable problem based on an intuitive principle of pulling objects together if they are of the same type, and pushing them apart if they are not. We then combine this principle with a flexible Indian Buffet Process prior on the latent variables. We show that the inferred supervised latent variables can be directly used to perform a nearest neighbour search for the purpose of retrieval. We introduce a new application of dynamically extending hash codes, and show how to effectively couple the structure of the hash codes with continuously growing structure of the neighbourhood preserving infinite latent feature space.\n</div>\n<div id=\"bib_quadrianto2013supervised\" class=\"collapse\">\n<b>BibTeX</b>:\n<pre>@inproceedings{quadrianto2013supervised,\n  author = {Quadrianto, Novi and Sharmanska, Viktoriia and Knowles, David A and Ghahramani, Zoubin},\n  title = {The Supervised IBP: Neighbourhood Preserving Infinite Latent Feature Models},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the 29th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence},\n  year = {2013},\n  url = {http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/pub/pdf/QuaShaKnoGha13.pdf}\n}\n</pre>\n</div>\n</li><li><div id=\"salimans2013\"><em>Salimans T and Knowles DA</em> (2013), <strong>\"Fixed-form variational posterior approximation through stochastic linear regression\"</strong>, Bayesian Analysis.

This is used to drive sequential tree building and greedy search to find optimal tree structures, corresponding to hierarchical clusterings of the data.

Unfortunately, Bayesian inference methods often require high-dimensional averages and can be slow to compute, especially with the potentially unbounded representations associated with nonparametric models. We address the challenge of scaling nonparametric Bayesian inference to the increasingly large datasets found in real-world applications, focusing on the case of parallelising inference in the Indian Buffet Process (IBP). Our approach divides a large data set between multiple processors. The processors use message passing to compute likelihoods in an asynchronous, distributed fashion and to propagate statistics about the global Bayesian posterior.

At Stanford I help out with <a href=\"http://stanford.edu/~rezab/smacc/\">SMACC</a>: Statistical, Mathematical, and Computational Consulting. </p>\n\n<h4>Lagrangian duality</h4>\n\n<p>I gave journal club was on convex optimisation. I think I finally got my head round Lagrangian duality, and hopefully came up with a reasonably intuitive explanation. My focus is on intuition rather than rigor, and is based almost entirely on Boyd and Vandenberghe's <a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/\">tome</a>. I thought I should write this up while it's still fresh, so here you go: <a href=\"lagrangian_duality.pdf\">Lagrangian Duality for Dummies</a>\n\n</p><h4>Binomial p-values</h4>\n\n<p>Following my <a href=\"454report.pdf\">work</a> on 454 pyrosequencing error rates with Professor Holmes, I was asked about how to calculate a p-value for comparing two draws from a Binomial distribution to test the hypothesis that the number of substitutions seen in the sample is significantly greater than the number of substitutions seen in the control. There is actually no need to use the Poisson approximation, and the Binomial distribution very naturally takes care of varying coverage. I explain my approach <a href=\"documents/454pvalues.pdf\">here</a>. </p>\n\n<h4>Infer.NET</h4>\n\n<p>During my PhD I was a  part-time developer of <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/infernet/\">Infer.NET</a>.
