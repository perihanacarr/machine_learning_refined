I am particularly interested in time-series analysis, transfer/multitask learning, and causal inference. The overarching goal of my research agenda is to develop the computational methods needed to help organize, process, and transform data into actionable knowledge. To find out more about my research interests and what the group is currently working on, please follow the \"Research\" link above. I received my PhD in 2014 from MIT. At MIT, I worked with Prof. John Guttag in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL). My PhD research focused on developing accurate patient risk-stratification approaches that leverage spatiotemporal patient data, with the ultimate goal of discovering information that can be used to reduce the incidence of healthcare-associated infections. In 2015, I was named Forbes 30 under 30 in Science and Healthcare; I received an NSF CAREER Award in 2016; in 2017 I was named to the MIT Tech Review's list of 35 Innovators Under 35; and most recently I received a Sloan Fellowship in Computer Science. for research in building data-driven models for predicting healthcare-associated infections.", "\u00a9 Jenna Wiens 2018.\n        "]}
