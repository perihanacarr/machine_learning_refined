From early work in end-user configuration of complex environments to more recent work in smart home interaction and personal informatics for health, I have contributed over fifty peer-reviewed articles to the scientific literature in Human-Computer Interaction, Ubiquitous Computing, and Health Informatics. My work draws upon a variety of methods, most prominently featuring qualitative research for gaining a deep understanding of users in particular domains, design, prototyping, and software development for embodying novel design approaches, and small-to-medium-scale field deployments to evaluate novel designs in use. I also employ experimental methods, research through design, online ethnography, crowd-based approaches, and machine learning needed.\nI have worked in a variety of application areas, including home entertainment, sustainable smart homes, accessible technology, and workplace collaboration. At present, my primary area of interest is mobile and smart health, where I am developing techniques to more effectively incorporate personal health data (a.k.a. patient-generated data) into both formal and informal health care settings. In this work, I am collaborating with researchers from a variety of disciplines, including medicine, engineering, and public health. For more information about my research, please see list of selected publications by topic area and/or my Google Scholar profile (for a mostly-complete list of my publications). If you are interested in a paper but aren\u2019t able to access it through the publisher\u2019s site or an academic article database, you can check Research Gate to see if a full-text is available there and request one if it\u2019s not. I\u2019ll try to respond to the request."]}
